Patch Manager automates the process of patching Windows and Linux managed instances. 
Use this feature of AWS Systems Manager to scan your instances for missing patches or scan and install missing patches. 
You can install patches individually or to large groups of instances by using Amazon EC2 tags.

AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Window lets you define a schedule to perform potentially disruptive actions on 
your instances such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches.

The workflow runs in the context of the current AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user. 
This means that you don't need to configure additional IAM permissions 
as long as you have permission to run the Automation document, or playbook, 
and any actions called by the document.
